The Adjusted Historical Hydrology represents current day hydrologic patterns, \

Statistical characteristics of historical rim inflow in California’s Central \
Valley show noticeable and statistically significant changes in the past 100 \
years. Standard deviations of precipitation and rim inflow from most of the \
rim watersheds in the early periods of the past 100 years are significantly \
different from the recent 30 years. These differences indicate that the \
non-stationary historical meteorological and hydrological data may not be \
completely representative of recent and current conditions. To develop a \
hydrologic data set for the entire modeled period that represents current \
hydrology, an adjusted historical hydrologic conditions data set was \
developed. The intent of the adjusted historical hydrologic conditions data \
set is to provide a reasonable representation of recent climatic conditions \
and serve as a basis for creating future climate change scenarios.
The standard deviation and monthly distribution of historical streamflow for \
the first 70 years of the period of record were adjusted to match the last 30 \
years via a combination of statistical scaling methods. The resulting data \
set is identical to the historical hydrologic conditions for water years 1992 \
